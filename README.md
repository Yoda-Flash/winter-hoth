# winter-hoth
A website for the Hack Club's Winter Boba Drops! Enjoy a winter on Hoth.

It involves CSS Animations of swooshing starships and falling snow, as well as some music! Make sure to click on the top-right button to activate the music for a maximized experience.
If you're lucky enough, you'll catch a Millenium Falcon swooshing by (there'll be an extra swooshing sound too!)

P.S. All sound effects must be activated by interacting with the website (you just need to click it once!) due to browser policy issues with autoplay.
